# Machine Learning Final Project
For our final project in Machine Learning, we decided to analyze the dataset of something that we both like. As such we picked a dataset that involves anime.

## Dataset
Data set was taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020?select=anime.csv

## The Algorithms
For this project we used three different types of training algorithms in order to compare and deerrtmine the best results and obervations. 
We used: 
<ul>
  <li> Polynomial Regression </li>
  <li> Linear Regression (Lasso) </li>
  <li> Deep Neural Network (DNN) </li>
</ul>

### Deep Neural Network (DNN)

For our DNN, we measured:
<ul>
  <li> our metrics using “mae” </li>
  <li> our loss was “mse”,  </li>
  <li> a learning rate of 0.1</li>
</ul>
